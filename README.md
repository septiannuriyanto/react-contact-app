A lessons from Dicoding React Developer Course<br>
Finished by Septian Nuriyanto

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Septian.<br>
I've been working in the coal mining industry for 11 years in the Supply Chain Management Department. Despite working in a energy sector company, I've fallen in love with programming since the first day I enter the college in 2009. I started learning programming language from C (in fact I'm still learning now because it's currently one of my lecture). After then I started some serious coding study to finish my capstone project in the first period of Android development in 2012.<br><br>

## Goals
To know more about React JS Fundamentals, and to build the first React App from scratch. Yes, I've built several projects in basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, so I don't have any difficulties in React Development prerequisites


## Outline
This app is produced with the React JS Library (I won't call it a framework) with some features like :

<li> Contact display (Image and description)
<li> Adding Contact
<li> Delete Contact

## Key Feature
There are some functional concepts I tried to implement in this project, including :
<li> Creating Basic Reusable React Components
<li> Using State and Props
<li> Basic Styling using CSS



## Changelog
